# HangmanGame
Big Picture:
Have you ever wanted to play a game of hangman but had no one to play it with?I will be programming a game of hangman which will use Turtle Programming to draw the “man” in the game with the appropriate number of limbs, etc. First the user will be prompted for a level of difficulty of the the word/ phrase choice, ranging from “easy”, “medium” and “hard”. This will generate a word with the appropriate number of blank spaces shown to the user based on the difficulty of word choice. The user will then input one letter at a time. If correct, all the letters in the word or phrase will appear on the screen. If incorrect, it will prompt the turtle program to open and draw the first element of the “man”, or the head in this case. After each input, the user will be asked if they want to guess the word, which they can answer either yes or no to. If they attempt to guess the word and are wrong, another element of the man will be drawn. After enough incorrect guesses where the drawing of the man is complete, the user will lose the game where an appropriate message will be displayed. If guessed correctly by the user’s input or if all the letters are guessed before the drawing is complete, it will display a “winning” message. In either case, the program will ask the user if they want to continue and play another game, in which the whole program will restart.

First Round:
First, user will only have choice of three different "easy" category words. Then, from a random, predetermined list of words, user will see instructions for game appear on screen and then the appropriate number of letter slots for the mystery word. Then, the user will be prompted to enter a letter. If correct, the letter will appear in the appropriate slot, if incorrect, turtle in game will draw a single body part of stick figure. User will then be asked if they want to guess the word. If stick figure is drawn before word is guessed or all letters correctly guessed, then player loses. Otherwise, player wins!
