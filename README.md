# HangmanGame
Have you ever wanted to play a game of hangman but had no one to play it with?I will be programming a game of hangman which will use Turtle Programming to draw the “man” in the game with the appropriate number of limbs, etc. First the user will be prompted for a level of difficulty of the the word/ phrase choice, ranging from “easy”, “medium” and “hard”. This will generate a word with the appropriate number of blank spaces shown to the user based on the difficulty of word choice. The user will then input one letter at a time. If correct, all the letters in the word or phrase will appear on the screen. If incorrect, it will prompt the turtle program to open and draw the first element of the “man”, or the head in this case. After each input, the user will be asked if they want to guess the word, which they can answer either yes or no to. If they attempt to guess the word and are wrong, another element of the man will be drawn. After enough incorrect guesses where the drawing of the man is complete, the user will lose the game where an appropriate message will be displayed. If guessed correctly by the user’s input or if all the letters are guessed before the drawing is complete, it will display a “winning” message. In either case, the program will ask the user if they want to continue and play another game, in which the whole program will restart.
